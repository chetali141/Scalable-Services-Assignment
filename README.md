# Scalable-Services-Assignment

It is a very small Flask based Python application depicting a library usecase.

The application has four endpoints:
1. Displays a basic 'Welcome' message.
2. Receives a book name as an input from user (index.html) and informs user if the book is available or not.
3. Lists all the books currently available in the library.
4. Receives a request from the user to add a new book into the library. (RequestBook.html)

The application is deployed on Kubernetes and Docker.
